      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="Intro">I am a developer and designer in the making. Where there is a will there is a way and I will find mine. Luckily, my favorite question is "Why?" My creativity started early as a child when I first learned to sew. Now my creativity as a professional has
        been sparked in so many ways. I can't wait to see where this web journey takes me.</p>

      <h3>SharePoint Design</h3>
      <p>I have recently designed a SharePoint site and want to expand my knowledge behind the scenes. SharePoint really helped me realize how much passion I have for web-design.</p>

      <h3>Articulate Rise 360</h3>
      <p>I should realized this as well when I created self-study courses with the Articulate program. Using the program, I created a story flow with simple designs and navigation to keep the users engaged with learning.

      <h3>Costume Challenge</h3>
      <p>However, if I am being completely honest, one of my best skills is sewing authentic halloween costumes. Scarlet Ohara's Green Curtain dress was my first initial costume that aspired me to challenge myself each Halloween to create something
        better. My other favorite costumes were I Dream of Jeannie and Sleeping Beauty.
